CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA. 

It allows developers to use NVIDIA GPUs for general purpose processing, an approach known as GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units).
