Key to leveraging the full power of CUDA is understanding the GPU architecture.

NVIDIA GPUs are comprised of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). 
Each SM can manage multiple threads concurrently, making GPUs exceptionally suitable for data-parallel computations where the same operation is applied to multiple data items. 

For instance, matrix multiplication, image processing, and physical simulations often benefit from GPU acceleration.

A typical CUDA-enabled GPU contains many SMs, each of which can execute thousands of threads. These threads are organized into blocks, which themselves are organized into grids. 

Each block runs on a single SM, allowing threads within the block to share data through fast shared memory and synchronize their execution.

Memory hierarchy in CUDA consists of several layers:

1. Global Memory: Accessible by all the threads which have high latency and is uncached.
2. Shared Memory: On-chip memory shared among threads of the same block, much faster than global memory.
3. Registers: Each thread has its private registers, providing the fastest but limited memory.
4. Constant and Texture Memory: Cached memories optimized for different access patterns.

three key aspects often come to the forefront:

1. Massive Parallelism: GPUs consist of hundreds or thousands of smaller, more efficient cores designed for handling multiple tasks simultaneously.
2. High Throughput: Due to their architecture, GPUs can process vast amounts of data per time unit.
3. Energy Efficiency: Modern GPUs deliver high computational power with lower energy consumption compared to traditional CPUs.
